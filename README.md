Responsive Design: The frontend is designed to be fully responsive, providing a seamless user experience on various devices and screen sizes.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling on both the client and server sides to provide clear feedback and improve user experience.
Data Validation: Ensures data integrity and correctness through validation rules applied both on the client and server sides.
Search and Filtering: Users can search and filter through [specific resources, e.g., articles, products, etc.] to find the information they need.
User Roles and Permissions: Different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) with specific permissions and access controls.
API Documentation: Automatically generated API documentation using tools like Django REST Frameworkâ€™s built-in documentation or Swagger for easy exploration of API endpoints.
Testing: Includes unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend to ensure code quality and functionality.)
